Developer History

How web apps were built in the early 2000s.

Instead of just JS, there was something called JQuery. It created an
environment for JS to flourish - helped accommodate for different browsers.

The backend used LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). 
PHP was used for logic on the servers.
Apache is a software that really efficiently serves up files.
PHP is now a very unpopular language in terms of growth and job opportunities.
