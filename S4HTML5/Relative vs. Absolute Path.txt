Relative vs. Absolute Path

What does https:// mean?

We used href without anything like that.
That is because that is an absolute path, that is exactly where 
it is stored in our file.
Using just about.html, for example, as the href is a relative path
that just checks the current folder. 
It basically means a path relative to where we currently are (can still
navigate down multiple directories).

An absolute link can be used from anywhere - for example, the png link 
of the apples.
