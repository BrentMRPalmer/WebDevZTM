Browsing the Web

What happens when you type something into web browser?

1) Who is google.com? Question asked to ISP (who you pay for internet, like Bell)
ISP -> internet service provider
2) I don't know him personally, but here is his address: 172.217.7.23 (like a phone book)
DNS -> domain name servers
3) DNS sends the request back to ISP, and then back to web browser
4) The browser uses Google's IP to contact the Google servers, 
and the Google servers return the necessary HTML, CSS, and Javascript files
Servers have a piece of software running that knows how to send files when requested
5) The web browser uses those files to display the web page
