HTML vs. HTML5

HTML originally wasn't as elaborate.

HTML5 is part of the evolution of HTML, which has more features
to improve user experience.

One of the goals is to not deprecate old HTML code - it should be 
backwards compatible. In other words, new HTML versions 
will only add new things.

HTML5 introduced an idea of semantic elements.
It adds more meaning so that web crawlers like Google's search 
engine can adequately recommend the website.

An example of a semantic element is
	<header>
		<h1>Register</h1>W
	</header>

	or

	<nav>
		<a href="www.google.com">
	</nav?

This gives a lot more meaning to the structure
of webpages.
